Batteries range from 10.5V to 13.7V (pretty hard limits for a lead-acid battery)
ATmega2560 has a analog input range from Aref -> GNC (Aref is a supply pin, so 3.3V on the APM)

Analog pins (S) are connected to PF0->7,PK0,SJ10-12

13.7/3.3=4.15, so err on the side of caution and make a 5-fold divider

1 + 3.3 gives a bit over this ratio (so a lower voltage)
Use high valued resistors to reduce wastage, so 1k and 3k3 
- Power draw would be 33mW for that arrangement.
- Can increase resistance to decrease power loss

100k and 330k chosen (due to avaliability)
- Needs soldering and testing.



CATCH: The common rail on the PSU is the + rail, this leads to complexities with the exact levels.
- the ATMega references its inputs from GND to a reference (either 1.1/2.56 internal, or external Aref)
- Assuming the 12V output from the solar controller is regulated to 12V, the ATMega's GND is 12V below the + rail
- Given the battern ranges from 10.5 to 13.7V, GND to the divider.
