# Backhaul current capacities:

- 130W motors at 12V require approx 11A
- Solar panel peaks at ~8.5A
- Solar controller is fused at 20A (TODO: Check with datasheet)
- Avaiable wire is Altronics W2110 (20AWG copper pair)
 > 5A according to website, just under quater max draw

## Motors
NOTE: Almost irrelevant, as the provided cables are suitably long to reach the controllers
- A small run from the controller to the jack is needed.
- 130W motors at 12V  = 10.833A ~= 11A

## Batteries
- Four batteries supplying a peak of 22A collective
- Long runs
 > 20AWG cable should be sufficient for single-battery runs (assuming so)
- Cross-hull run can be doubled-up.
 > Or use higher-grade cable (W4150, see solar)
 > Get heatshrink to cover the join between connector cable and extension)



## Solar Connection
- Short run to solar controller
- Two connection pairs (one internal, one external)
 - OR: Single connection pair? (Hard to do, have to thread wire though)
- Needs proper wire, try W4150 (28AWG copper, 11A rated)
 > Join using H2309 (15A 2way male+female inline connector)
