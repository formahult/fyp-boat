With the solar charger specified, we can't get a battery level reading to the APM. Unless the charger's display is the charge level, and is convertable to an analogue signal.

The voltage supplied by SLA batteries is proportional to the stored charge. Rough ideas are that at our approximate discharge rate, 11V is completely discharged. 11.5 will be a suitable cutoff (indicating 20%)
