Batteries range from 10.5V to 13.7V (pretty hard limits for a lead-acid battery)
ATmega2560 has a analog input range from Aref -> GNC (Aref is a supply pin, so 3.3V on the APM)

Analog pins (S) are connected to PF0->7,PK0,SJ10-12

13.7/3.3=4.15, so err on the side of caution and make a 5-fold divider

1 + 3.3 gives a bit over this ratio (so a lower voltage)
Use high valued resistors to reduce wastage, so 1k and 3k3 
- Power draw would be 33mW for that arrangement.
- Can increase resistance to decrease power loss

100k and 330k chosen (due to avaliability)
- Needs soldering and testing.



CATCH: The common rail on the PSU is the + rail, this leads to complexities with the exact levels.
- the ATMega references its inputs from GND to a reference (either 1.1/2.56 internal, or external Aref)
- Assuming the 12V output from the solar controller is regulated to 12V, the ATMega's GND is 12V below the + rail
- Given the battery ranges from 10.5 to 13.7V, GND to the divider.
 > Rough estimates are 11.8 (dead) to 14.5 (under charge)




VRef values are 1.1V, 2.56V, or AVCC (3.3V)
- The AREF pin is left floating (connected to an unused pad on the board)
- Pick AVCC as that allows a larger range




Floating Basis
==============

The controller (original, unknown about new) has the + terminals common. This means that the 0 point for the ADC isn't the 0V point for the batteries.

Battery Voltage
---------------
11.8V to 14.5V max range

Output voltage
--------------
Theory (requires testing): Output voltage is regulated to 12V
- Likely issue: This controller supports both 12V and 24V operation, will it still supply 12V when the batteries are in a 24V arrangement?
- The controller does autodetect the operating voltage, so could be picking a regulation voltage based on that
- TODO: Test when new controller arrives

Voltage Sensing
-------------

Drawing a diagram where 0V is the common + rail shows that the battery voltage can be divided and compared with the APM ground with minimal issues.
However, this will lead to a negative relation between ADC reading and the battery voltage (assuming the output voltage is constant).
If the output volage is the battery voltage, then the reading will be positively linear.


### Equations (Assuming fixed output)
All voltages are relative to the common `+` rail, and calculated values are rounded to 3 decimal places.

Battery divided voltage (max)
$-14.5 \times \frac{3.3}{1 + 3.3} = ~-11.128$

Battery divided voltage (min)
$-11.8 \times \frac{3.3}{1 + 3.3} = ~-9.056$

APM GND
$-12 = -12$
APM AVCC (largest ADC reference)
$-12 + 3.3 = -8.7$


Analog input (max battery)
$~-11.128 - -12 = ~0.872$
Analog input (min battery)
$~-9.056 - -12 = ~2.944$

### Equations (Assuming dynamic output)
All voltages are relative to the common `+` rail, and calculated values are rounded to 3 decimal places.

Battery divided voltage (max)
$-14.5 \times \frac{3.3}{1 + 3.3} = ~-11.128$

Battery divided voltage (min)
$-11.8 \times \frac{3.3}{1 + 3.3} = ~-9.056$


Analog input (max battery)
$~-11.128 - -14.5 = 3.372$
Analog input (min battery)
$~-9.056 - -11.8 = 2.744$

### Limit checks

With fixed 12V output, range is easily met with current divider. However, if the output follows the battery, then the range is violated at max charge.
- This will require a smaller divisor to fit the range.
- We want the max difference to be 3.3, set max to 3.1 for safety? For that

$3.1 = -V_{max} \times K - -V_{max}$
$3.1 = -( V_{max} \times K - V_{max} )$
$3.1 = -V_{max} \times (K - 1)$
$3.1 = V_{max} \times (1 - K)$
$\frac{3.1}{V_{max}} = 1 - K$


For a max voltage of 14.5, the `K` ratio should be $0.786$. Putting a $10\Omega$ and a $2.7\Omega$ resistor arrangement will provide a `K` of $0.787$. (Giving an actual voltage of 3.08V)


### Conclusion
In both cases, a resistor divider will work to provide the battery reading, the difference is the ideal ratio
- For fixed voltage, the existing 3.3 + 1 ratio will work
- For dynamic voltage, an updated ratio of 10 + 2.7 is required
