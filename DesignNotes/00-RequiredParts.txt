## Battery monitor? (reporting battery level to the APM)
- Would need to be integrated with the charger? OR - Use a voltage divider to take 12V down to 3V and directly monitor the battery line voltage.
- Not really possible. Maybe look into patching into the charger, or use active times.
- Rough voltage monitor on the battery? Voltage divider?
  - See `00a-BatteryCharge.md`

## Batteries!
Already avaliable, will use 4x 12V SLAs

## Thrusters/Bracket

## 5/3.3V Regulator

- 5V is a good voltage, but going down to ~3 would be more efficient.
- 5 does allow us to run the modem off a lower voltage.

## Connectors
### APM Serial 2: 1.25mm 4pin plug

### APM Power: 1.25mm 6pin plug

### Contacts for the above

### Modem Power: 2.1mm center positive barrel plug
TODO. Need the exact measurements of the plug.
- 5.5mm outer circumference, ~2mm pin
- 5.5mm,2.1mm plugs exist.
 [http://au.rs-online.com/web/p/dc-power-plugs/8840950/](RS Electronics)

### Wires
- 2x Modem power (Standard power guage)
- 2x APM power input (Small guage, suitable for 1.25mm)
 - Measured to be 1mm incl insulation
 - 26AWG is the smallest altronics have, and the largest suitable for the plugs.
- 4x TTL serial (Same as above, connect to standard pins)
- 2x 3+2 ESC extensions. (???)
  - Just need to extend the control lines.
- Power distribution. (Large-ish guage, as it's 12V and maybe 1A)
  - Pre-made 12V cable can work nicely. (Black w/ white stripe cable)

NOTE: These should be avaliable from altronics with minimal fuss, so are not cruicial to order early
- [http://www.altronics.com.au/cable/hookup-non-shielded/?prdv=26AWG](Altronics - 26AWG) - $.30/m
- [http://www.altronics.com.au/cable/hookup-non-shielded/?prdv=13AWG](Altronics - 13AWG) - $2.05/m

Length:
- Short runs to 5V PSU (10cm each max?)
- Long-ish runs to the ESCs (one in each hull)
- Long runs for power (About four 700mm-800mm runs)
