Supply Capacity
===============

Supply: 100W solar panel
- Approximate power ratio is 4Wh per W of panel (for Perth) = `400Wh` per day
 - [https://www.solarchoice.net.au/blog/how-much-energy-will-my-solar-cells-produce/](Source)
- Halve to have charging capacity for cloudy days. = `200Wh` per day
- Divide by 24 hours to get the max constant drain = `8.3W`
- Subtract peak control drain of 600mW (See bellow) = `7.7W`
- Distribute between two motors = `3.8W`


Control Electronics
===================

APM Board
---------

Peak current draw for major chips
- (Main CPU) ATMega641 : 15mA + io currents
- (USB CPU) ATMega32U2 : 21mA + io
- (DataFlash) AT45DB161D : 17mA
- (Accelerometer) MPU-6000 : 3.6mA (with all units enabled)
- (Altimiter) MS5611-01BA : 1.4mA (absolute peak)
Total: 58mA

Regulation Overhead
- NOTE: Regulator is limited to 100mA continious output, so 330mW max drain from APM board
- Linear regulator, so leads to board looking like a 5V supply at 3.3V current

Total Power: ~300mW peak


Side-Units
---------

- GPS Module: ~30mA
- Satellite Modem: 450mA peak (during operation, not constant)
 - Assuming active for two mins per hour = 1/30 usage on average
 - 15mA usage.
- Data Logger: 6mA max

Total Power:
- 51mA
- 255mW

3G Modem
-------
Measurements taken with USB, 5V
- 43mA idle
- 130mA at boot
- USB 500mA peak


Control Total
---------
- ~600mW
